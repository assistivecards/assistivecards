Most Samsung mobile devices infamously comes with their own TTS Drivers called Samsung Text-to-Speech. Access to this speech synthesiser is usually buggy, their support for languages other than English is sparse or not existed.

If you are having issues with your device sounding "weird", follow this steps to change your default speech drives into "Google Text-to-Speech"

## Install Google TTS

Most Samsung devices comes with Google TTS installed but not enabled, some old devices might not have Google TTS installed at all. To install it;

* Launch your "Google Play Store" on your Samsung device
* Search for "Google Text-to-Speech" and install the app from Google LLC

* Go to your Samsung Device "Settings"
* Depending on the version of your Android, either go to "General Management > Language and Input" or "System > Language and Input"
* Press "Text-to-speech"
* Then press "Prefered engine"
